          Growing up, I had always displayed a keen interest in technology and sciences. 
          Starting from the age of 13, I personally studied programming. I mainly began learning with Python, before moving onto some of the basics of C++ and JavaScript. Throughout that age, I indulged in many small personal projects such as simple text-based RPG games and very rudimentary chatbots.

          I created this website out of a rekindled interest in JavaScript, HTML, and writing code in general that stemmed from A Level IT Class. With what knowledge I had, I decided to build this website using the Three.JS library as the main attraction and used CSS Grid and the Vite build tool to allow me to set the website up much better.

              Moving to Bali and entering a new highschool, I faced a rough transition that would explain my stunted academics in my eleventh grade. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Going through it, however, I strived, and I found a lot of interest in my A Level Math and IT classes. I set my mind on being more competent in my academics, which resulted in high grades in Math and various subjects, a 1480 on my SATs, a band 8.5 on my IELTS academic test, and even a top score in IT Class.

              Since the eleventh grade, I've participated in my school's Study Buddy program where I tutor lower graders on subjects such as math and science every week. Starting from the twelfth grade, I've also been one of four people in my school's student council, acting officially as the treasurer of our organization.
            </p>

            <p id="content8" class="child">
              Furthermore, I also partake in my school's community service which allows me to teach English to kids in rural schools on a near weekly schedule. One student-council related event which I help organized also supported the aforementioned rural schools by raising funds as high as 38,000,000 IDR to supply books and supplies for them. To top it all off, I was also the lead vocalist for my school's music band, performing in various events and competitions, which significantly developed my aptitude for public speaking and performing.
